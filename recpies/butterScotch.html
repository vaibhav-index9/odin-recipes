    <p>
      Butterscotch is a type of confectionery whose primary ingredients are
      brown sugar and butter. Some recipes include corn syrup, cream, vanilla,
      and salt. The earliest known recipes, in mid-19th century Yorkshire, used
      treacle (molasses) in place of, or in addition to, sugar.

      Butterscotch is similar to toffee, but the sugar is boiled to the soft
      crack stage, not hard crack. Often credited with their invention,
      Parkinson's of Doncaster made butterscotch boiled sweets and sold them in
      tins, which became one of the town's best-known exports. They became
      famous in 1851 after Queen Victoria was presented with a tin when she
      visited the town. Butterscotch sauce, made of butterscotch and cream, is
      used as a topping for ice cream (particularly sundaes).

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>100g butter, melted, plus a little for the dish</li>
      <li>275g self-raising flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>300g light brown soft sugar</li>
      <li>250ml whole milk</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
      <li>4 tbsp Carnation caramel</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil the kettle and heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a
        rectangular baking dish (about 20cm x 28cm and 4cm deep). Tip the flour,
        baking powder, 140g sugar and a large pinch of salt in a bowl. Put the
        butter, milk and eggs in a jug and whisk together. Pour the wet
        ingredients into the dry and mix well. Scrape into the baking dish and
        level the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the remaining sugar with the golden syrup and caramel, add 300ml
        boiling water and stir until the sugar and caramel dissolves. Pour the
        hot liquid over the pud, then bake for 1 hr until the top is set and the
        sauce is starting to bubble around the edges. Serve hot with ice cream.
        If you leave this pudding to sit, the sauce will soak into the sponge,
        so eat immediately.
