    <p>
      Molten chocolate cake is a dessert that consists of a chocolate cake with
      a liquid chocolate core. It is named for that molten center,and it is also
      known as chocolate coulant ("flowing"), chocolate lava cake, or simply
      lava cake. It should not be confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that
      contains little flour, but much chocolate and butter, hence melting on the
      palate (but not on the plate).

      French chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, for his part, said that he invented
      the dish in New York City in 1987. He recalled pulling a chocolate sponge
      cake from the oven before it was done and finding that the center was
      still runny, but warm with both a good taste and texture. He has been
      credited with popularizing the molten chocolate cake in the United States,
      where it became an almost de rigueur inclusion on high-end restaurant
      dessert menus in the 1990s.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>100g butter, plus extra to grease</li>
      <li>100g dark chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>150g light brown soft sugar</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>50g plain flour</li>
      <li>single cream, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Butter 6 dariole moulds or basins well
        and place on a baking tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put 100g butter and 100g chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl and
        set over a pan of hot water (or alternatively put in the microwave and
        melt in 30 second bursts on a low setting) and stir until smooth. Set
        aside to cool slightly for 15 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an electric hand whisk, mix in 150g light brown soft sugar, then 3
        large eggs, one at a time, followed by ½ tsp vanilla extract and finally
        50g plain flour. Divide the mixture among the darioles or basins.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can now either put the mixture in the fridge, or freezer until
        you're ready to bake them. Can be cooked straight from frozen for 16
        mins, or bake now for 10-12 mins until the tops are firm to the touch
        but the middles still feel squidgy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully run a knife around the edge of each pudding, then turn out
        onto serving plates and serve with single cream.
      </li>
    </ol>
