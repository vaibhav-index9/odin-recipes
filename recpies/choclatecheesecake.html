    <p>
      Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main,
      and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese
      (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If
      there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made
      from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or
      sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually
      refrigerated).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in
      different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other
      flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and
      visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit,
      whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other
      ingredients.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the cornflakes and half a jar of chocolate hazelnut spread in a bowl
        and beat to combine – don’t worry about breaking up the cornflakes.
        Press the mix into the base of a 23cm springform tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth, then fold in the
        remaining chocolate hazelnut spread. Smooth onto the cornflake base,
        wrap tightly in cling film and freeze overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the freezer 30 mins before serving, or until you can cut it
        easily with a sharp knife. Serve in slices with hazelnuts sprinkled
        over. Will keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.
